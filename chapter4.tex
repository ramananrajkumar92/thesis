\section{Theorems on bounds of time and space usage}
give bounds of time and space usage, one for interval 1 up to N, the other one from M to N. 10+ pages
\subsection{bounds of time with no space usage}
given an input $N$, calculate the average time for $r_p$ where $p<N$ in $O(blah)$ bit operations (time??) and $O(blah)$ space. 2+ pages
\subsection{bounds of time with space constraints}
given an input $M,N$, calculate the average time for $r_p$ where $M<p<N$ in $O(blah)$ bit operations (time???) and $O(blah)$ space. Use Stage 1 and 2 ideas. 3+ pages 
\subsection{why the bounds are useful}
Explain how if you have limited memory, can use the stage 1 and 2 ideas to calculate it. prove the bounds for the width of each block in stage 1 and width for each tree of the forest in stage 2. 5+pages
